# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the **AirBnB Clone Project**! This project is part of a journey to build a full-stack web application similar to the core functionality of AirBnB. 

In this first step, weâ€™ll create a **command-line interpreter** to manage AirBnB objects, setting the foundation for upcoming projects involving HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.
